<h1>TCreator - Terraria Modding Evolved</h1>
<b>TCreator</b> is a node-based compositor used to generate Terraria mod code for use with <a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader">tModLoader</a>. Features an intuitive easy-to-learn interface and an integrated code editor. It's powered by the open-source Godot Engine, which you can learn more about <a href="https://godotengine.org">here.</a><br><br>
I was advised by many not to make this a real thing, let alone publish it, but FUCK IT. And FUCK you.
